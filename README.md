Project Overview:
This project is a web application built using the Bootstrap framework. It showcases information about different football leagues and provides various features such as a light/dark mode switch, form submission, table with pagination, alerts, progress bars, spinners, off-canvas content, and tab view. The application also includes a comment section and an "About Us" section.

Instructions to Run the Application Locally:
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the HTML file and save it with a .html extension (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. The application should now be running locally, and you can interact with its features.

Additional Notes or Considerations:
1. This application uses Bootstrap version 5.3.0. Ensure that you have an internet connection when running the application, as it includes references to external CSS and JavaScript files hosted on CDNs.
2. Make sure to include the required image files (`epl.jpg`, `Bundesliga.jpg`, `leage1.png`, `LaLiga Color Codes.png`) in the same directory as the HTML file for the images to display correctly.
3. The application includes placeholders and dummy content. Feel free to customize and replace them with your own content as needed.
4. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file is referenced in the HTML file. If you plan to modify or extend the functionality of the application, you can add your JavaScript code to that file or create a new one.
5. Ensure that your web browser supports the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features used in the application for optimal compatibility and functionality.

Note: This is a static HTML application, so it does not require any server-side setup. You can simply open the HTML file in a web browser to run it.
